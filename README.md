# Hi, I'm Bridget Ebeling 👋

## AI Systems Builder | Cybersecurity MSc Candidate

I build applied AI systems that transform messy real-world data into practical, explainable decision-support tools. My work centers on deterministic logic design, AI-assisted data normalization, and structured LLM workflow architecture.

Currently completing an MS in Cybersecurity (Expected 2026) with emphasis on AI safety, interpretability, and forensic reasoning systems.

Background in anthropology and behavioral analysis informs my approach to ethical, human-centered technology design.
